  Keep PR title verbose enough and add prefix telling about what source it touches e.g "[rss] Add feature xyz" or if the
  the PR is not realated to a source use "[core]", e.g. "[core] Fix xyz".

  If you add a breaking change within your PR you should add ":warning:" to the title,
  e.g. ":warning: [core] My breaking change"
