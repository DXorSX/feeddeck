# Email Templates

This folder contains all the email templates for Supabase. We are using
[React Email](https://react.email) to build the templates.

## Get Started

To use the templates you have to install all the dependencies first:

```sh
npm install
```

Then you can run the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the
result.

To generate the HTML files for all templates run the following command. The HTML
files can then be found in a folder named `out`.

```sh
npm run export
```
